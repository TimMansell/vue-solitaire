  How to play
  <p>
    The aim of the game is to successfully move all cards from the bottom 8
    board columns to the top 4 foundation columns.
  </p>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <h3>Face up cards</h3>
  <p>
    You can move any face up card to any other face up card providing:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      the card being moved to is exposed at the bottom of the column (no
      cards below it)
    </li>
    <li>the cards are the same suit and is one value lower</li>
    <li>both cards aren't on the same column</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, you can move 5♦ to 6♦ but <em>not</em> 8♦ to 7♦.</p>
  <p>Moving a card will also move all the cards below it.</p>
  <h3>Kings</h3>
  <p>
    If you clear out a column you can only move a <strong>K</strong> to fill
    that column. All cards below the <strong>K</strong> will also be moved
    to that column.
  </p>
  <h3>Foundation</h3>
  <p>
    Cards can only be moved to the foundation columns in the following
    order: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>only one suit per column is allowed.</li>
    <li>
      you can only move an exposed card at the bottom of the column (no
      cards below it)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Moving cards</h2>
  <p>
    You can move cards by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="display-on--click">
      clicking and dragging the card(s) to the desired column
    </li>
    <li>
      clicking on the card you want to move and then clicking on the desired
      column. All cards below the selected card will be moved as well
    </li>
    <li>
      double <span class="display-on--click">clicking</span> <span class="display-on--touch">tapping or swiping up</span> on cards
