      The aim of the game is to successfully move all cards from the bottom 8
      board columns to the top 4 foundation columns.
    </p>
    <h2>Face up cards</h2>
    <p>You can move any face up card to any other face up card providing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the card being moved to is exposed at the bottom of the column (no cards
        below it)
      </li>
      <li>the cards are the same suit and is one value lower</li>
      <li>both cards aren't on the same column</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, you can move 5♦ to 6♦ but <em>not</em> 8♦ to 7♦.</p>
    <p>Moving a card will also move all the cards below it.</p>
    <h2>Kings</h2>
    <p>
      If you clear out a column you can only move a <strong>K</strong> to fill
      that column. All cards below the <strong>K</strong> will also be moved to
      that column.
    </p>
    <h2>Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      Cards can only be moved to the foundation columns in the following order:
      A, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>only one suit per column is allowed.</li>
      <li>
        you can only move an exposed card at the bottom of the column (no cards
        below it)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Moving cards</h2>
    <p>You can move cards by:</p>
    <ul data-test="rules-overlay-move-list">
      <li class="show-on-click">
        clicking and dragging the card(s) to the desired column
      </li>
      <li>
        clicking on the card you want to move and then clicking on the desired
        column. All cards below the selected card will be moved as well
      </li>
      <li>
        double <span class="show-on-click">clicking</span>
        <span class="show-on-touch">tapping or swiping up</span> on cards will
        move them to the foundation columns
      </li>
    </ul>
